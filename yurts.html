canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.</dd>
      <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
      <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, 
mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and
cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
      <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
      <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
It&#39;s also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
